## Assignment 2 Stochastic Simmulation course UVA december 2024 
This code belongs to the paper "Queueing Theory", which aims to provide insights into queuing theory. We take different models from this field, explore some of their key properties and compare them to each other. We use different performance measures, such as average waiting times, in order to arrive at meaningful comparisons. Our results highlight the features of each of the different models, providing insights into their application in queuing theory.
